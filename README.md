# What is multipass?

Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux and MacOS. It's designed for
developers who want a fresh Ubuntu with a single command or hotkey. It uses
KVM on Linux and HyperKit on MacOS to run the VM with minimal overhead.
Multipass will fetch images for you and keep them up to date.

Since it supports metadata for cloud-init, you can simulate a small cloud
deployment on your laptop or workstation. See [Using cloud-init with Multipass](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/04/02/using-cloud-init-with-multipass)
on the Ubuntu blog for more details.

# Install Multipass

On Linux it's available as a snap:

```
sudo snap install multipass --beta --classic
```

For macOS we provide installers [on GitHub](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/multipass/releases).

# Usage

```
$ multipass find

## Learn more about the VM instance you just launched
```
$ multipass info dancing-chipmunk

## Connect to a running instance

```
$ multipass shell dancing-chipmunk
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-42-generic x86_64)

...
```

Don't forget to logout (or Ctrl-D) or you may find yourself heading all the
way down the Inception levels... ;)

## Run commands inside an instance from outside
```
$ multipass exec dancing-chipmunk -- lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:  Ubuntu

```

## Stop an instance to save resources
```
$ multipass stop dancing-chipmunk
```

## Delete the instance
```
$ multipass delete dancing-chipmunk
```

It will now show up as deleted:
```$ multipass list
Name                    State             IPv4             Release
snapcraft-asciinema     STOPPED           --               Ubuntu Snapcraft builder for Core 18
dancing-chipmunk        DELETED           --               Not Available
```

And when you want to completely get rid of it:

```
$ multipass purge
```

## Get help
```

multipass help
multipass help <command>
```

# Get involved!

Here's a set of steps to build and run your own build of multipass:

## Build Dependencies

```
cd <multipass>
apt install devscripts equivs
mk-build-deps -s sudo -i
```

## Building

```
cd <multipass>
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

## Running multipass daemon and client

```
sudo <multipass>/build/bin/multipassd &
<multipass>/build/bin/multipass launch --name foo
```
